# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Glumplum.DND

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

DnD 5e tool used for character creation, and if plausible, includes a simple VTT function along with the basic necessities of playing DnD

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The intention of this project is to create a tool to be used while playing DnD 5e that can assist new players with tasks that may seem daunting at first, while
also supplementing as a useful tool for more experienced players that allows for a more streamlined experience with more menial tasks. If this project proves to
be an achievable accomplishment and I feel I have room to take this project further, I hope that it can even server as an outright VTT to be used in online
campaigns.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project 
would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time 
than you hope.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two 
classmates, who will do what?

There will be a lot behind this project, and I will need to learn an incredible amount of varying skills. I will need to learn how to properly make a 
webpage that is accessible, and will also need to learn how to properly format the page to look usable, likely needing to learn HTML. 
Once I have learned how to use HTML, I will need to create multiple
dorpdown bars and fillable boxes for numbers in the appropriate places. I will need to then code the proper math to make the numbers in DnD function without a 
completely manual experience for the user. After I complete the base coding, if I am able to take it further, I will need to implement both multiple pages 
that switch without erasing the data input into any page not shown on the screen (perhaps a save function), as well as implement a settings option to add 
extra rules if the user feels inclined to do so. Another more advanced possibilty will be to implement an option to create a private room with coded 
entry and possibly the "DM" being able to create designated profiles with unique logins, and along with the room, functions such as a chatbar that can be 
accessed by each user in the room, which can be used for rolling by using an input such as "/roll 2d20" which will produce 2 randomized numbers between 1 and 20. 
Implementation of a hotbar will be a fantastic addition if plausible, allowing the user to input their own function, or 'drag and drop' any weapon or item 
that already has an associated function (such as a greatsword you are proficient with having an attack roll formula of "1d20 + @mod + @prof" while the damage 
roll would have a formula of "2d6 + @mod", both of which can be altered by the user to include any bonuses such as adding +2 to ranged attacks with archery 
fighting style.)
