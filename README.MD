This project was an incredibly exhausting endeavor. When we first officially began the project, I had searched quite a bit for project partners in hopes of finding someone with any coding experience, but preferably 
experience in HTML. In fact when I first started this project, I didn't even know that I would also need Javascript, because I didn't know HTML was only for what is actually appearing on the webpage. This is my 
first dive into coding, and it was a hell of a solo project. It definitely would have been easier to make a visual novel or a simple gimmick-based game, but I'm glad I went with this as my topic, even if it was 
overwhelming trying to essentially sculpt stone with my forehead. Being honest with myself I have no idea how I managed to make my HTML and Javascript code work in such a short time, but I'm happy with what 
I managed to accomplish. I think the most daunting challenge presented here was how empty everything felt starting out. I've barely started with Python, and now I'm trying to make code in two different languages 
I've never even seen before? I really thought I would have to begrudgingly ask for an opportunity to change my project and go with something easier. I stayed up so many nights until 7 in the morning just 
trying to understand where I went wrong and how to fix it, then how to better it, and repeat that cycle again and again. But like I already said, I'm glad I ended up sticking with this project, because it 
follows a topic I am passionate about. With what I managed to learn and accomplish, I'm actually understanding this enough that I can keep working on this and polishing it further even after this gets graded.
I'll probably add every race and subrace next since it's an easy addition, and simply a matter of being extremely time consuming to properly format each description of every race and subrace, and then after that 
maybe I can look into creating a function that ports the end results into a PDF of a 5e Character sheet. But that is for later, since my time for development is up.

I had so many issues and problems I encountered, I can't possibly even remember every single one of them. That said, I think one coding issue that consistently plagued me was that the choice stats would stay 
visible for races that didn't get choice stats, or races that DID get choice stats would keep the options hidden and lock it out of selection since I also added a feature that prevents a stat-choice race from 
calculating without selecting their choice stats. I tried and tried fix after fix after fix for hours and even days. From start to finish this was a problem. But I managed to fix it, and while it still shows the 
stat-choices bonus1 and bonus2 at the start, I managed to make a work-around by having the site start the user off on "select a Race" as the default race, which allows the site to update anytime a different race is
selected. I also had a lot of trouble getting stat-choice to be a dynamic trait that would automatically apply to any race that uses these bonus stats, but it kept breaking the code and I had to compromise by 
specifying that half-elves specifically need to show the bonus1 and bonus2 selections. Height on the site was also a major issue for some time. As I mentioned earlier, I have absolutely zero coding experience, 
and so HTML was entirely new to me. Anytime the stats were calculated, the descriptions of selected races would end up stretching the site and cutting out the top half of the site, forcing the user to refresh the 
page if they wanted to try anything else, which is a major annoyance, especially if you just wanted to make a minor tweak to your stats/build or if you wanted to compare two options. I also was having quite a lot
of trouble with properly importing descriptions.js, which was extremely important to me because I didn't want to add all of these long-winded paragraphs into the meat and potatoes code that is pointbuy_4.js
For reference, the reason it is called 4 is because the first three attempts were such catastrophic failures I genuinely felt that I was better have starting from scratch than trying to salvage the mess I made in 
those attempts. I don't like staying organized, it's tedious and time-consuming. But after all the problems I encountered, I did my best to try and consistently add notes and labels both for myself and for you who 
will be looking that code over. 
Outside of coding issues, there were plenty of logistical issues I had to deal with. Near the start of this semester, I was working 40+ hour workweeks along with my fulltime schedule here at Temple, and I was in 
the process of closing on a house, Which made the start incredibly rough for me, trying to manage my time to the point that a 15 minute delay could cause major problems, and was overall unpleasantly stressful.
While I closed on the house and finished with all of the emails and calls and paperwork, I still have a mortgage to handle, and I am not fortunate enough to have safety nets like having my parents help pay for 
any expenses. I continued working, and I of course was unable to take care of any coding while I was at work, especially given that I work physical security, which has absolutely nothing to do with computers.
I can't really explain why, but the past 3 or 4 weeks I have been suffering from some terrible insomnia, much worse than just not having enough time to sleep like the first half of the semester. I have been 
consistently laying in bed for 4+ hours trying to fall asleep, and at a certain point, I've given up on trying and just stay up later than I should working on code like I am right now. My head has been aching 
my eyes have been burning quite a lot lately. Not pleasant but I'm trying to drink enough water to dull it. 

Overall, I didn't even come close to what I had originally hoped I would create. Not even slightly. I thought I would be more competent, and that I would somehow find a way to get all of those listed features 
complete before the due date, but I wasn't able to. Maybe I was just underestimated the complexity of coding. In a way, coding is actually fun, though I honestly feel slightly hesitant to admit that. It's 
entertaining to work through this, like a puzzle. That said I do not enjoy the long nights of coding and recoding, I enjoy that ray of sun peeking in through the window as I realize it's morning, and I am FINALLY 
done with what I had set out to do. It's a nice feeling, despite originally anticipating the problem to be resolved in 2 hours at the very most.
